# FishGoBrrr

A mod that adds [buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io) support to [WebFishing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/)

## Setup
todo

## Config
There are a bunch of options to adjust your *experience* such as vibration strengh and length in `{WEBFISHING}/GDWeave/configs/deltaneverused.fishgobrrr.json`

## Building

To build the project, you need to set the `GDWeavePath` environment variable to your game install's GDWeave directory (e.g. `G:\games\steam\steamapps\common\WEBFISHING\GDWeave`). This can also be done in Rider with `File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Toolset and Build | MSBuild global properties` or with a .user file in Visual Studio.
